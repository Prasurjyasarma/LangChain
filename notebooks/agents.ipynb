      "Summary: Errol Graham Musk (born 25 May 1946) is a South African businessman, politician, and the patriarch of the Musk family. He was a member of Pretoria City Council from 1972 to 1983, and was a member of the Progressive Federal Party from 1980 to 1983 before resigning over political disagreements. As a businessman, he worked as a mechanical engineering consultant, developed properties, and invested in various ventures including emerald trading.\n",
      "Musk married Maye Haldeman in 1970, and they had three children: Elon, Kimbal and Tosca. Haldeman divorced him in 1979, saying he was abusive. He has since had two other marriages and four other children. His son Elon is the wealthiest person in the world.\n",

      "Summary: Elon Musk is a businessman and entrepreneur known for his leadership of Tesla, SpaceX, Twitter, and xAI. He is the wealthiest individual in the world, and a former U.S. government employee.\n",
      "Despite rejecting the conservative label and describing himself as a political moderate, Musk's views have become increasingly right-wing over time, leading them to be characterized as far-right and libertarian authoritarian.\n",
      "As the owner of Twitter, he has been accused of suppressing critics and allowing the spread of misinformation. Following his involvement in European politics, Musk’s public statements have received criticism from several world leaders. He frequently comments on topics ranging from science and technology to religion and philosophy.\n",
      "Within the context of American politics, Musk voted for Democratic candidates from 2008 before switching to Republican candidates in 2022 and supporting Donald Trump in 2024, with whom he had previously feuded. He identifies as a \"free speech absolutist\" and has expressed support for universal basic income, gun rights, a carbon tax, and H-1B visas. Conversely, he has criticized the wealth tax, short-selling, government subsidies, and Wikipedia. Musk has voiced concern about the perceived dangers of artificial intelligence and climate change, while also opposing public transportation systems, rejecting labor unions, and promoting pronatalism.\n",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Musk defied lockdown orders, calling them \"fascist\", supported the Canada convoy protest against vaccine mandates, and made several contentious epidemiological claims. He has promoted conspiracy theories and made controversial statements that have led to accusations of racism, sexism, antisemitism, Islamophobia, transphobia, and spreading misinformation and disinformation.\n",
      "While describing himself as a \"pro-Semite\", his remarks about George Soros and Jewish communities have drawn condemnation from the Anti-Defamation League and the White House. An immigrant himself, Musk has blamed immigration policy for illegal immigration, been described as anti-immigration, and has promoted misleading narratives about voter fraud in the United States.\u001b[0m\n",

      "Summary: Elon Reeve Musk (born June 28, 1971) is a businessman and entrepreneur known for his leadership of Tesla, SpaceX, Twitter, and xAI. Musk has been the wealthiest person in the world since 2021; as of October 2025, Forbes estimates his net worth to be around $500 billion.\n",
      "Born into a wealthy family in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk emigrated in 1989 to Canada; his Canadian citizenship is congenital, his mother having been born there. He received bachelor's degrees in 1997 from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, United States, before moving to California to pursue business ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded the software company Zip2. Following its sale in 1999, he co-founded X.com, an online payment company that later merged to form PayPal, which was acquired by eBay in 2002. That year, Musk also became an American citizen.\n",
      "In 2002, Musk founded the space technology company SpaceX, becoming its CEO and chief engineer; the company has since led innovations in reusable rockets and commercial spaceflight. Musk joined the automaker Tesla as an early investor in 2004 and became its CEO and product architect in 2008; it has since become a leader in electric vehicles. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI to advance artificial intelligence (AI) research, but later left; growing discontent with the organization's direction and their leadership in the AI boom in the 2020s led him to establish xAI. In 2022, he acquired the social network Twitter, implementing significant changes, and rebranding it as X in 2023. His other businesses include the neurotechnology company Neuralink, which he co-founded in 2016, and the tunneling company the Boring Company, which he founded in 2017. In November 2025, a Tesla pay package worth $1 trillion for Musk was approved, which he is to receive over 10 years if he meets specific goals.\n",
      "Musk is a supporter of global far-right figures, causes, and political parties. He was the largest donor in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, where he supported Donald Trump. After Trump was inaugurated as president in early 2025, Musk served as Senior Advisor to the President and as the de facto head of DOGE. After a public feud with Trump, Musk left the Trump administration and returned to managing his companies.\n",
      "Musk's political activities, views, and statements have made him a polarizing figure. Musk has been criticized for COVID-19 misinformation, promoting conspiracy theories, and affirming antisemitic, racist, and transphobic comments. His acquisition of Twitter was controversial due to a subsequent increase in hate speech and the spread of misinformation on the service. His role in the second Trump administration attracted considerable public backlash, particularly in response to DOGE.\n",

      "Having been first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, around 75% of Musk's wealth was derived from Tesla stock in November 2020. Describing himself as \"cash poor\", he became the first person in the world to have a net worth above $300 billion a year later. By December 2024, he became the first person to reach a net worth of $400 billion. In October 2025, Musk's net worth reached $500 billion according to Forbes.\n",
