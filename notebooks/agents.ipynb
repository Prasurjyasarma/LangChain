      "Summary: Elon Reeve Musk (born June 28, 1971) is a businessman and entrepreneur known for his leadership of Tesla, SpaceX, Twitter, and xAI. Musk has been the wealthiest person in the world since 2021; as of October 2025, Forbes estimates his net worth to be around $500 billion.\n",
      "Born into a wealthy family in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk emigrated in 1989 to Canada; his Canadian citizenship is congenital, his mother having been born there. He received bachelor's degrees in 1997 from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, United States, before moving to California to pursue business ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded the software company Zip2. Following its sale in 1999, he co-founded X.com, an online payment company that later merged to form PayPal, which was acquired by eBay in 2002. That year, Musk also became an American citizen.\n",
      "In 2002, Musk founded the space technology company SpaceX, becoming its CEO and chief engineer; the company has since led innovations in reusable rockets and commercial spaceflight. Musk joined the automaker Tesla as an early investor in 2004 and became its CEO and product architect in 2008; it has since become a leader in electric vehicles. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI to advance artificial intelligence (AI) research, but later left; growing discontent with the organization's direction and their leadership in the AI boom in the 2020s led him to establish xAI. In 2022, he acquired the social network Twitter, implementing significant changes, and rebranding it as X in 2023. His other businesses include the neurotechnology company Neuralink, which he co-founded in 2016, and the tunneling company the Boring Company, which he founded in 2017. In November 2025, a Tesla pay package worth $1 trillion for Musk was approved, which he is to receive over 10 years if he meets specific goals.\n",
      "Musk is a supporter of global far-right figures, causes, and political parties. He was the largest donor in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, where he supported Donald Trump. After Trump was inaugurated as president in early 2025, Musk served as Senior Advisor to the President and as the de facto head of DOGE. After a public feud with Trump, Musk left the Trump administration and returned to managing his companies.\n",
      "Musk's political activities, views, and statements have made him a polarizing figure. Musk has been criticized for COVID-19 misinformation, promoting conspiracy theories, and affirming antisemitic, racist, and transphobic comments. His acquisition of Twitter was controversial due to a subsequent increase in hate speech and the spread of misinformation on the service. His role in the second Trump administration attracted considerable public backlash, particularly in response to DOGE.\n",

      "Having been first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, around 75% of Musk's wealth was derived from Tesla stock in November 2020. Describing himself as \"cash poor\", he became the first person in the world to have a net worth above $300 billion a year later. By December 2024, he became the first person to reach a net worth of $400 billion. In October 2025, Musk's net worth reached $500 billion according to Forbes.\n",

      "*   **Green:** When bananas are first picked and are unripe, they are typically a vibrant **green**. At this stage, they're quite firm, starchy, and not very sweet.\n",
      "*   **Yellow:** As they ripen, the green gradually fades, and they turn that familiar **bright yellow**. This is when they're at their peak sweetness and have that soft, creamy texture we all love.\n",
      "*   **Yellow with Brown Spots:** If you let them ripen even further, the yellow skin will start to develop small **brown or black spots**. These are often called \"sugar spots\" because the banana inside becomes even sweeter and softer, making them perfect for baking, like in banana bread!\n",
      "*   **Brown/Black:** Eventually, if left for too long, the entire skin can turn **brown or even black**. While they might not look appealing to eat fresh at this point, the fruit inside is incredibly sweet and still perfectly good for cooking or smoothies.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, while **yellow** is the iconic banana color, they actually go through a whole spectrum of hues as they mature! Bananas are fascinating, aren't they? They're botanically considered a berry, by the way, and they grow in tropical regions all over the world, like Ecuador, the Philippines, and India. They're also packed with potassium and vitamin B6!\n"
